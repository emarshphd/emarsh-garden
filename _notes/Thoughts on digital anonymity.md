# Thoughts on digital anonymity

> "On the internet, no one knows you're a dog."

Identity fluidity, hiding, passing are inherent abilities in digitally networked spaces. In other words, anonymity is the default online. While this presents possibilities to escape bodily determinism(s) and avoid discrimination, it foregrounds the need/desire to do so, possibly even reifying the very structures anonymity tried to avoid. 

Contrast anonymous, disembodied identities with the phenomonen of doxing, or publically revealing someone's personal information, such as address, phone number, workplace, and names and locations of relatives. With doxing (as well as, perhaps SWATTING), someone's real, lived, embodied experience becomes forcibly, sadistically revealed.
